# AGE: Anxious Game Engine

A game engine written in C++ just for fun and education. 
With it I'm learning concepts and practces underlying the creation of a game engine and some concepts related to github.

For more up to date version of source code check [Dev branch](https://github.com/nightingazer/AGE/tree/dev),
and for some info on project's future and some roadmap you can check [AGEngine project](https://github.com/users/nightingazer/projects/1)

Highly inspired by [Yan Chernikov's](https://github.com/TheCherno) [Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel), thanks to him for his wonderfull series on the matter.
